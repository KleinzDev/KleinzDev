## Hi!

ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ | I'm Kleinz, I'm a 14 year old high school student, currently in my 2nd year. I'm a full-stack web developer. I have a fascination with creating things which people find useful or appreciate.

### What I work with
- **ExpressJS**\
I use ExpressJS to build REST APIs for most of my web applications, it serves as the backend for those.
- **VueJS**\
Most of my personal projects use VueJS as the frontend, with the frontend interfacing with a REST API backend. I use it to build a SPA (single page application) with client-side routing, which allows for a fluid user experience for all.
- **AdonisJS**\
A full-stack NodeJS web framework, "Laravel for NodeJS". I don't really use this for personal projects, although I do have experience with it, thanks to projects I've worked on with other people
- **PHP**\
My first language, my experience with it includes both vanilla PHP and frameworks such as Lumen or Laravel. Nowadays, I've switched over to using NodeJS frameworks for ALL of my personal projects, so you won't see me using this in personal projects anytime soon.
- **MySQL**\
SQL server, self explanatory. As PHP was my first programming language, I used MySQL as that's the most popular. Nowadays I've mostly switched to PostgreSQL.
- **PostgreSQL**\
SQL server, which I use in most of my personal projects.
- **Redis**\
An in-memory store, I use it in most projects for session storage and as a cache layer to provide excellent scalability.
